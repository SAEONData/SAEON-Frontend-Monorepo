# SAEON-Frontend-Monorepo

This repository will evolve to become SAEON's react component library.
Here we'll develop shared components and applications for the FRAME 1, 2 and 4 domains.

Architecture: 
A monorepo with Lerna, Yarn workspaces, create-react-app (with hot-module-replacement) and Storybook
